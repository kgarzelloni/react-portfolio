# 20: React Portfolio, Karrie Garzelloni
## 02/17/2022

This objective of this assignment was to update my professional portfolio for engaging future prospective employers using react technology. Updates to this version include links to group project and coding coursework that showcases my abilities to this point in the bootcamp. For this version of my portfolio, I experimented the use of boostrap templates for a polished UI while maintaining the integrity of the content as informative for future prospective employment opportunities.
