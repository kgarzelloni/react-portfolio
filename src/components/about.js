                        professional horizons. 
                        I work best in teams and believe how we collaborate is the key to a team's success. Many brains is always better than one. 
                        As a gal who hails from the Pacific Northwest, I have a real fondess for the beauty of the
                        Sonoran Desert. Tucson has become an easy place for me to call home. Give me all the stunning sunsets,
                        stately saguaro, and spicy salsa. I'm also a sucker for a good alliteration. </p>
